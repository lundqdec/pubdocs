### Notes
Has Discord, took data from the pile, diva, flashback etc. Ended up with 1,2 TB of quality data.
Used the Berzelius Superpod (Nvidia).

### Key takeaways
The LLM is just pre-trained at the moment, it need fine tuning to be able to work as a InstructGPT, however it will soon be available. Available at huggingface as model.

## Should We Teach Machine Learning Systems?

### Notes
Text "frees author and audience from time and space". Kids are exposed to 100k to 1M words per month, reading is adding 50% more. Enter knowledge graphs? Contextual anchoring. Represent knowledge in structures. Introduce learning models.

### Key takeaways
Machines learn in a to common and simple way. We do not teach machines to learn like humans. Maybe we should introduce learning models.

### Notes
Many ecosys models: have no terrain, have no reinforcement learning. Versatility, no rescue robots that can climb any mountain. Fruit flies analogy, can survive everywhere. Unity asset stores for animals. Deep reinforcement, award model. What if... hunting, sea level, build roads. Perlin noise (check-up). Ecotwin 2.0 geocode interface and drag and drop animals.

### Key takeaways
The concept of an Ecotwin. What-if scenarious. Was unfortunately not tested practical yet. Used Unity.

## P-Tuning: A Parameter Efficient Tuning to Boost LLM Performance

### Notes
P-tuning or prompt-tuning is an efficient way to come up with virtual prompts and inference the model. This was done in Swedish so a translation service was used.

### Key takeaways
P-tuning is a way for a LLM to "read between the lines", i.e. getting smarter.

## Synthetic Data for Computer Vision Problems, When Real Annotation Is Too Expensive
by Abgeiba Isunza Navarro
Machine Learning Engineer | Modulai
[![Synthetic](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtPvwBHjAF0?si=F-xqgu33d03AUGdY)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtPvwBHjAF0?si=F-xqgu33d03AUGdY)

### Notes
CVision, SYNTHIA - City images
Unity Perception to create synthetic data
"Fake it until you make it" - Synthetic data can give similar results as real data

Cons: Domain gap and expensive

Use cases
- E-sport tracking
- Anomaly detection on electric wires
- Finding a gas-tank lid of a car

### Key takeaways
It is like a reverse annotation, you create the image from the annotation (or prompt) to train on. Could be powerful with DALL-E or Midjourney? Consider: labeling vs cost for synthetic data.

### Notes
Recognizing geometry is typical human, but not for animals.

Use cases
- Training images on human brain
### Key takeaways

### Notes
"Bring the data to the training and not the training to the data".
[scaleoutsystems/fedn: A scalable, resilient and model agnostic federated learning framework. (github.com)](https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn)
### Key takeaways
Used for high privacy use cases where data needs to stay on-premise on multi-site.

### Notes
laszlo.substack.com
Tech-debt vs tech-mess, there is a difference
- Adapter pattern
- Factory pattern
- Strategy pattern

### Key takeaways
There has been a gap between classical development architecture and ML-project. This talk was to address this gap and increase knowledge in the ML-community.
